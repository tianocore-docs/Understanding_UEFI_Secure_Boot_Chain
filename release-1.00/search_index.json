Running unauthorized firmware components may introduce significant threats by creating a permanent denial of service or introducing persistent malware. In 2011, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published BIOS Protection Guidelines (SP800-147). NIST extended the scope to all platform firmware and published Platform Firmware Resiliency Guidelines (SP800-193) in 2018. The goal of those documents is to provide a general guideline for firmware integrity.\nIntegrity Models \nThe UEFI Secure Boot chain can be applied to the Clark-Wilson integrity policy, developed in 1987. The Clark Wilson model includes the following concepts:\n\nData Item:\n\nConstrained Data Item (CDI)\n\nUnconstrained Data Item (UDI)\n\n\n\nProcedure:\n\nIntegrity Verification Procedure (IVP)\n\nTransformation Procedures (TPs)\n\n\n\nRule:\n\nCertification Rule (CR) – integrity monitoring\n\nC1: (Basic: IVP Certification) All IVPs must properly ensure that all CDIs are in a valid state.\n\nC2: (Basic: Validity) All TPs must be certified to be valid. For each TP and each set of CDI that it may manipulate, the security officer must specify a “relation” of the form: (TP, {CDI}).\n\nC3: (Separation of Duty Certification) The list of relation in E2 must be certified to meet the separation of duty requirement.\n\nC4: (Journal Certification) All TPs must be certified to write to an append-only CDI (the log) all information necessary to permit the nature of the operation to be reconstructed.\n\nC5: (Transformation Certification) Any TP that takes a UDI as an input value must be certified to perform only valid transformations, or no transformations, for any possible value of the UDI. The transformation should take the input from a UDI to a CDI, or the UDI is rejected.\n\n\n\nEnforcement Rule (ER) – integrity preserving\n\nE1: (Basic: Enforcement of Validity) The system must maintain the list of relation specified in C2, and must ensure that only TPs certified to run on a CDI manipulate that CDI.\n\nE2: (Enforcement of Separation of Duty) The system must associate a user with each TP and set of CDIs in a list of relations of the form: (User, TP, {CDI}). It must ensure that only executions described in one of the relations are performed.\n\nE3: (User Identity) The system must authenticate the identity of each user attempting to execute a TP.\n\nE4: (Initiation) Only the agent permitted to certify entities may change the list of such entities associated with other entities, specifically the one associated with a TP. An agent that can certify an entity may not have any execute rights concerning that entity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis model is based on the relationship between authenticated principal, program, and data items. The elements of this relationship are referred to as the “Clark-Wilson Triple” (User, TP, {CDI}). The Clark-Wilson model shows the rules required to meet the security properties of integrity: (from Blake).\nTable 1-1: Clark-Wilson model\n\n\n\nProperty\nDescription\nRule\n\n\n\n\nIntegrity\nAn assurance that CDIs can only be modified in constrained ways to produce valid CDIs.\nC1, C2, C5, E1, E4\n\n\nAccess Control\nThe ability to control access to resources.\nC3, E2, E3\n\n\nAuditing\nThe ability to ascertain the changes made to CDIs and ensure that the system is in a valid state.\nC1, C4\n\n\nAccountability\nThe ability to uniquely associate users with their actions.\nE3.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1-1: Clark-Wilson model, From Lee\nBecause the Clark-Wilson focuses on duty and transaction, it is more applicable to business and industry processes. Currently, some papers describe how to apply the Clark-Wilson integrity model to the existing system, such as Windows, Java or Trusted Computing Group (TCG) security.\nIntroduction to the Secure Boot Chain \nAccording to NIST SP800-147 and SP800-193, the system needs to maintain integrity and availability during the firmware boot process. In firmware, secure boot (aka verified boot) uses a set of policy objects to verify the next entity before execution. For example, to match C5, the system uses the TP (verification procedure) to verify the UDI (untrusted firmware component), transforms the UDI into a CDI (trusted firmware component), and executes it.\nIn contrast, a trusted boot (aka measured boot) process does not verify the next entity. It only records the digest of the next boot entity to a trusted location, such as a Platform Configuration Register (PCR) in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). This allows a trusted boot chain to be verified later in the boot process. Many security models use secure boot and trusted boot capabilities in combination for maximum effectiveness.\nTable 1-2: Clark-Wilson model in Firmware\n\n\n\nProperty\nDescription\nRule\nFirmware Secure Boot\n\n\n\n\nIntegrity\nAn assurance that CDIs can only be modified in constrained ways to produce valid CDIs.\nC1, C2, C5, E1, E4\nYes.

The Clark Wilson model includes the following concepts:\n\nData Item:\n\nConstrained Data Item (CDI)\nUnconstrained Data Item (UDI)\n\n\nProcedure:\n\nIntegrity Verification Procedure (IVP)\nTransformation Procedures (TPs)\n\n\nRule:\n\nCertification Rule (CR) – integrity monitoring\n\nC1: (Basic: IVP Certification) All IVPs must properly ensure that all CDIs are in a valid state.\n\nC2: (Basic: Validity) All TPs must be certified to be valid. For each TP and each set of CDI that it may manipulate, the security officer must specify a “relation” of the form: (TP, {CDI}).\n\nC3: (Separation of Duty Certification) The list of relation in E2 must be certified to meet the separation of duty requirement.\n\nC4: (Journal Certification) All TPs must be certified to write to an append-only CDI (the log) all information necessary to permit the nature of the operation to be reconstructed.\n\nC5: (Transformation Certification) Any TP that takes a UDI as an input value must be certified to perform only valid transformations, or no transformations, for any possible value of the UDI. The transformation should take the input from a UDI to a CDI, or the UDI is rejected.\n\n\n\nEnforcement Rule (ER) – integrity preserving\n\nE1: (Basic: Enforcement of Validity) The system must maintain the list of relation specified in C2, and must ensure that only TPs certified to run on a CDI manipulate that CDI.\n\nE2: (Enforcement of Separation of Duty) The system must associate a user with each TP and set of CDIs in a list of relations of the form: (User, TP, {CDI}). It must ensure that only executions described in one of the relations are performed.\n\nE3: (User Identity) The system must authenticate the identity of each user attempting to execute a TP.\n\nE4: (Initiation) Only the agent permitted to certify entities may change the list of such entities associated with other entities, specifically the one associated with a TP. An agent that can certify an entity may not have any execute rights concerning that entity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis model is based on the relationship between authenticated principal, program, and data items. The elements of this relationship are referred to as the “Clark-Wilson Triple” (User, TP, {CDI}). The Clark-Wilson model shows the rules required to meet the security properties of integrity: (from Blake).\nTable 1-1: Clark-Wilson model\n\n\n\nProperty\nDescription\nRule\n\n\n\n\nIntegrity\nAn assurance that CDIs can only be modified in constrained ways to produce valid CDIs.\nC1, C2, C5, E1, E4\n\n\nAccess Control\nThe ability to control access to resources.\nC3, E2, E3\n\n\nAuditing\nThe ability to ascertain the changes made to CDIs and ensure that the system is in a valid state.\nC1, C4\n\n\nAccountability\nThe ability to uniquely associate users with their actions.\nE3.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1-1: Clark-Wilson model, From Lee\nBecause the Clark-Wilson focuses on duty and transaction, it is more applicable to business and industry processes. Currently, some papers describe how to apply the Clark-Wilson integrity model to the existing system, such as Windows, Java or Trusted Computing Group (TCG) security.\n"},"introduction-to-the-secure-boot-chain.html":{"url":"introduction-to-the-secure-boot-chain.html","title":"Introduction to the Secure Boot Chain","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

In firmware, secure boot (aka verified boot) uses a set of policy objects to verify the next entity before execution. For example, to match C5, the system uses the TP (verification procedure) to verify the UDI (untrusted firmware component), transforms the UDI into a CDI (trusted firmware component), and executes it.\nIn contrast, a trusted boot (aka measured boot) process does not verify the next entity. It only records the digest of the next boot entity to a trusted location, such as a Platform Configuration Register (PCR) in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). This allows a trusted boot chain to be verified later in the boot process. Many security models use secure boot and trusted boot capabilities in combination for maximum effectiveness.\nTable 1-2: Clark-Wilson model in Firmware\n\n\n\nProperty\nDescription\nRule\nFirmware Secure Boot\n\n\n\n\nIntegrity\nAn assurance that CDIs can only be modified in constrained ways to produce valid CDIs.\nC1, C2, C5, E1, E4\nYes.

It guarantees that only valid 3rd party firmware code can run in the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) firmware environment. UEFI Secure Boot assumes the system firmware is a trusted entity. Any 3rd party firmware code is not trusted, including the bootloader installed by the Operating System Vendor (OSV) and peripherals provided by an Independent Hardware Vendor (IHV). The end user may choose to enroll and revoke entries in the UEFI Secure Boot image security database as part of managing verification policy.\nUEFI Secure Boot includes two parts - verification of the boot image and verification of updates to the image security database. Figure 2-1 shows the UEFI Secure Boot verification flow. Table 2-1 shows the key/image security database used in UEFI Secure Boot.\n\nFigure 2-1: UEFI Secure Boot\nTable 2-1: Key Usage in UEFI Secure Boot\n\n\n\nKey\nVerifies\nUpdate is verified by\nNOTES\n\n\n\n\nPK\nNew PK New KEK New db/dbx/dbt/dbr New OsRecoveryOrder New OsRecovery####\nPK\nPlatform Key\n\n\nKEK\nNew db/dbx/dbt/dbr New OsRecoveryOrder New OsRecovery####\nPK\nKey Exchange Key\n\n\ndb\nUEFI Image\nPK/KEK\nAuthorized Image Database\n\n\ndbx\nUEFI Image\nPK/KEK\nForbidden Image Database\n\n\ndbt\nUEFI Image + dbx\nPK/KEK\nTimestamp Database\n\n\ndbr\nNew OsRecoveryOrder New OsRecovery####\nPK/KEK\nRecovery Database\n\n\n\nUEFI Secure Boot Image Verification \nTable 2-2: UEFI Secure Boot Image Verification\n\n\n\nItem\nEntity\nProvider\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nTP\nUEFI Secure Boot Image Verification\nOEM\nOriginally on flash, loaded into DRAM\n\n\nCDI\nManufacture Firmware Code\nOEM\nOriginally on flash, loaded into DRAM\n\n\n\nUEFI Secure Boot Image Security Database (Policy)\nEnd user (or OEM default)\nOriginally on flash, authenticated variable region, loaded into DRAM\n\n\nUDI\n3rd party Firmware Code, (OS boot loader)\nOSV\nOriginally on external storage (e.g. Hard drive, USB), loaded into DRAM\n\n\n\n3rd party Firmware Code, (PCI Option ROM)\nIHV\nOriginally on PCI card, loaded into DRAM\n\n\n\n3rd party Firmware Code, (UEFI Shell Tool)\nAny\nExternal Storage (e.g. hard drive, USB), loaded into DRAM\n\n\n\nTable 2-2 shows the component involved in the UEFI Secure Boot Image Verification.\nSigning \nIn UEFI Secure Boot, the UDI is any 3rd part firmware code, including the OS boot loader, PCI option ROMs, or a UEFI shell tool.

This feature verifies the entire OEM platform firmware image using two components:\n\nAuthenticated Code Module (ACM) Initial Boot Block (IBB) Verification\n\nMicrocode ACM Verification.\n\n\nFigure 2-4 shows the components involved in Intel® Boot Guard.

The ACMs modules assume responsibility to verify OEM platform firmware before the host CPU transfers control to OEM firmware. Because verifying the entire image is time-consuming, the ACM only verifies the initial boot block (IBB) code. The IBB is then responsible for verifying the OEM boot block (OBB).\nSigning \nThe UDI here is the firmware IBB, so only the IBB needs to be signed.\nPublic Key Storage \nIntel® Boot Guard defines a set of Manifests to record the signature information.\n\nBoot Policy Manifest – It records the hash of IBB and is signed by the Key Manifest Key.\n\nKey Manifest – It records a set of hashes for the public key pair which signs the Boot Policy Manifest, and it is signed Boot Guard Key.\n\nKey Hash - It records the hash for the public key pair which signs the Key Manifest. It is provisioned into the PCH hardware.\n\n\nThe Key Hash is read-only. It cannot be updated.\nThe Boot Policy Manifest and Key Manifest can be updated in the firmware.\nVerification \nDuring runtime update, the TP – ACM IBB Verification gets the CDI - Key Hash from PCH - and verify the first UDI – the Key Manifest. If the verification passes, the Key Manifest is transformed into a CDI. Then ACM continues to get the key hash from the CDI - Key Manifest - and verify the UDI - Boot Policy Manifest. If the verification passes, the Boot Policy Manifest is transformed into a CDI. Then the ACM gets the final UDI – Firmware IBB code - and verify it according to the CDI – Boot Policy Manifest. If the final verification passes, then the Firmware IBB is transformed into a CDI, and the ACM transfers control to the IBB.\nMicrocode ACM Verification \nThe ACM binary is signed by Intel. Now the question becomes who verifies the ACM binary. The answer is the CPU Microcode.\nTable 2-6: Microcode ACM Verification\n\n\n\nItem\nEntity\nProvider\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nTP\nMicrocode ACM Verification\nIntel\nCPU\n\n\nCDI\nMicrocode\nIntel\nCPU\n\n\n\nACM Key hash\nIntel\nCPU\n\n\nUDI\nACM Code\nIntel\nOriginally on flash, loaded into AC-RAM\n\n\n\nSigning \nThe UDI is the ACM binary. As such, the ACM needs to be signed with the Intel key.\nPublic Key Storage \nThe hash of the ACM public key is inside of the CPU. A debug ACM is signed with the debug key. A production ACM is signed with the production key.\nThe policy can NOT be updated.\nVerification \nDuring the ACM launch, the CPU Microcode loads the UDI - ACM to authenticated code execution area. Then the TP – ACM verification performs the verification. If the verification passes, then the UDI is transformed to CDI, the ACM starts executing. If the verification fails, the TXT shutdown is signaled.\nThe Intel® Boot Guard is one implementation to support boot ROM verification. Some other projects may have similar functions, such as Cerberus.\nOBB Verification \nIntel® Boot Guard only verifies the initial boot block (IBB) of the whole OEM Firmware. To make sure the whole OEM Firmware is unmodified, the IBB needs to verify the reset OEM boot block (OBB).\nTable 2-7: OBB Verification\n\n\n\nItem\nEntity\nProvider\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nTP\nOBB Verification\nOEM\nOriginally on flash, loaded into DRAM\n\n\nCDI\nFirmware Initial Boot Block, aka IBB\nOEM\nOriginally on flash, loaded into DRAM\n\n\n\nOBB Hash, OBB public key hash (Policy)\nOEM\nOriginally on flash, loaded into DRAM\n\n\nUDI\nFirmware OEM Boot Block, aka OBB\nOEM\nOriginally on flash, loaded into DRAM\n\n\n\nSigning \nThe UDI is OBB, which is not verified by IBB. Since both IBB and OBB are provided by OEM, the OEM may define a separate specific format to sign the OBB.\nPublic Key Storage \nThe OBB public key hash must be stored into the IBB region to make sure it is validated by ACM. As implementation choice, OEM may store the OBB hash directly to the IBB without using the public key.\nVerification \nDuring Firmware boot, the TP is the OBB verification code inside of IBB. If the OBB passes the verification, the OBB is installed by IBB. If the OBB fails the verification, the OBB is skipped.\n"},"secure_boot_chain_in_uefi/boot_chain__putting_it_all_together.html":{"url":"secure_boot_chain_in_uefi/boot_chain__putting_it_all_together.html","title":"Boot Chain – Putting it all together","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

NIST provides multiple guidelines for authenticated updates (SP800-147, SP800-147B, SP800-193). EDK II implements authenticated updates based on Signed UEFI Capsule Updates and Capsule Recovery. Table 2-8 describes firmware update verification.\nTable 2-8: Firmware Update Verification\n\n\n\nItem\nEntity\nProvider\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nTP\nFirmware Update Verification\nOEM\nOriginally on flash, loaded into flash unlockable environment.

As such it can be used to verify the new firmware binary.\nA policy may be updated along with the new Firmware image.\nVerification \nDuring the firmware update process, TP is inside of the original firmware image. TP will load the new firmware image from external storage into memory. The memory can be normal DRAM (if the update happens before any 3rd party code is executed) or flash (in an unlocked state). If the update must occur after 3rd party code execution, the update must occur in an isolated execution environment (example: SMRAM). Care must be taken that both verification and update occur in the same environment, and there is no TOC-TOU threat (example: DMA attack). If TP passes verification, the new firmware image is programmed into flash. If verification fails, the flash update process is aborted.\nIntel® BIOS Guard \nThe implementation above assumes any code in the execution environment is secure. Reality shows that this is difficult to implement due to the number of drivers present in this environment. Intel provides the Intel® BIOS Guard solution which only allows the flash device to be programmed by the Intel® BIOS Guard AC module. This module performs firmware verification and updates in an Authenticated Code RAM (AC-RAM) environment. This is designed to prevent issues early in the firmware boot process or SMM from impacting the verification and update flow.\nFigure 2-6 describes Intel® BIOS Guard components.

During boot, the early BIOS needs to program the public key hash into the CPU BIOS Guard register. This is used by the BIOS Guard module during the verification. The policy may be updated along with the new BIOS image.\nVerification \nDuring the firmware update process, a SMM module will load the firmware image and trigger the BIOS Guard module. TP is inside of the BIOS Guard module. TP first verifies if the OEM public key in the new firmware image matches the CPU BIOS Guard register, then verifies if the signature of the new firmware image. If TP passes verification, the BIOS Guard module writes the new firmware image into flash. If the verification fails, BIOS Guard returns with a failure.\n"},"secure_boot_chain_in_uefi/signed_recovery.html":{"url":"secure_boot_chain_in_uefi/signed_recovery.html","title":"Signed Recovery","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

During S3 resume phase, firmware loads the resume state to quickly “wakeup” the system and return to an operational state.\nDuring S3 resume, firmware should not accept untrusted external inputs. The system configuration, referred to as the S3 Boot Script, should be stored in a secure place. EDK II implements a lockbox for the S3 resume state. This implementation provides no UDI for S3 resume, so all components should be treated as CDI.\n"},"secure_boot_chain_in_uefi/smm_runtime_communication.html":{"url":"secure_boot_chain_in_uefi/smm_runtime_communication.html","title":"SMM Runtime Communication","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

One usage of SMM is that the Firmware may provide some special service in SMM, which is referred to as an SMI handler. The SMI handler uses a shared buffer (SMM Communication Buffer), to convey information to the service consumer during OS runtime. Table 2-11 describes SMM Runtime Communication Verification.\nTable 2-11: SMM Runtime Communication Verification\n\n\n\nItem\nEntity\nProvider\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nTP\nSMM Communication Verifier Code\nOEM\nOriginally on flash, loaded in SMRAM\n\n\nCDI\nSMI handler\nOEM\nOriginally on flash, loaded in SMRAM\n\n\nUDI\nSMM communication buffer\nAny\nDRAM\n\n\n\nThe SMM communication buffer is not signed because any program may use the buffer to invoke SMM services.

Most system components rely on some form of device firmware. The scope of PFR covers both system firmware and device firmware images, so the trust chain is maintained for all boot firmware components. See Figure 4-1 for an overview diagram.\n\nFigure 4-1: Component and Trust Chain, from NIST SP800-193\nDevice firmware may exist in a device-specific region that is managed by the device. In some cases, device firmware may reside in the same location as the system firmware, such as Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) attached to flash, and the system firmware is responsible for loading the device firmware into a device firmware region.\nMost device firmware initializes the hardware so it is functional at runtime. Examples include:\n\nNetwork Interface Card (NIC)\nSolid State Drive (SSD)\nUniversal Serial Bus (USB)\nBattery management\n\nSome device firmware is involved in the system boot process and may play an important role in system firmware verification. Examples include:\n\nEmbedded Controller (EC) firmware\nBaseboard Management Controller (BMC) firmware\nIntel® Converged Security and Management Engine (Intel® CSME)\nGlue logic in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD)\n\nThere are multiple existing standards describing device authentication, including:\n\nPCIe Device Security\nUSB Authentication\nSecurity Protocol and Data Model (SPDM)\n\nFigure 4-2 shows a high-level view of an authentication protocol.\n\nFigure 4-2: High-level View of PCIe® Component Authentication (source: PCIe® Component Authentication)\n"},"looking_forward__platform_firmware_resiliency/device_firmware_boot.html":{"url":"looking_forward__platform_firmware_resiliency/device_firmware_boot.html","title":"Device Firmware Boot","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

This feature protects critical firmware from attacks during boot and runtime. It can be treated as an implementation of Project Cerberus or NIST SP800-193.\nIntel PFR also enables a protect-in-transit feature, allowing customers to lock and unlock systems to guard against firmware changes during shipment. and “Intel transparent supply chain with platform certificate to create transparency in the supply chain to prevent counterfeit components from being used.”\nFigure 4-7 shows the Intel PFR system diagram.

Aside from basic secure boot, Titan implements remediation and first-instruction integrity. These features are like functions found in Intel Boot Guard and Project Cerberus.\n“Trust can be re-established through remediation in the event that bugs in Titan firmware are found and patched, and first-instruction integrity allows the platform to identify the earliest code that runs on each machine’s startup cycle.”\n-- “Titan in depth: Security in plaintext” (cloud.google.com)\nFigure 4-10 shows the Titan System Integration diagram.

Selections include processor microcode, CPLD devices, or FPGA devices. Each has its particular advantages and disadvantages. For example, processor microcode has a limited protection scope, which is why many customers use add-on devices for hardware RoT (CPLD, FPGA).\n"},"glossary.html":{"url":"glossary.html","title":"Glossary","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
